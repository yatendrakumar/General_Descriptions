limit switches are a type of sensor that detect presence and absence. 

Specifically, mechanical limit switches are switches that are 
mechanically activated, meaning that they have some sort of arm,
lever, knob, plunger, etc., which is physically—or mechanically
—activated by making contact with another object. 

As the object makes contact with the
actuator of the switch, it eventually moves the actuator to its
“limit” where the contacts change state. 

Other varieties of sensors/switches exist, including proximity 
sensors, light sensors, electric switches, among others.


In its simplest form, a limit switch is a “switch” that can be
mounted into remote locations ( small  location where you wil 
not aspect the human touch or less humans ( small area apart 
from the  comapany where the people will do their research ) ) 

so that it is actuated by an object other than a human operator.

Some basic functions of limit switches are:
• Detecting presence/absence
• Counting
• Detecting range of movement
• Detecting positioning & travel limit
• Breaking a live circuit when unsafe conditions
arise
• Detecting speed
• ...and hundreds of other applications
