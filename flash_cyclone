Cyclone for Renesas Overview


P&E Microcomputer Systems' Cyclone for Renesas is an extremely 
flexible tool designed for in-circuit flash programming of Renesas
 R8C, M16C and M16C/80, M32C, H8 and H8S/Tiny devices.

By connecting to the debug header on the target, the Cyclone 
can program internal memory on a Renesas processor or external 
flash connected to the processor's address/data bus. 

The processor or memory device can be mounted on the final printed 
circuit board before programming.

The Cyclone may be operated interactively via Windows based 
programming applications as well as under batch or dll commands 
from a PC. 

Once loaded with data by a PC it can be disconnected and operated 
manually in a completely stand-alone mode via the LCD menu and 
control buttons. The Cyclone has over 7Mbytes of non-volatile memory, 
which allows for the onboard storage of multiple programming images. 
When connected to a PC for programming or loading it can communicate 
via the ethernet, USB, or serial interfaces.
	
The Cyclone comes with intuitive configuration software, as well 
as easy to use automated control software. Support is currently 
available for the R8C, M16C/M32C, and H8 families - you may view 
a list of supported devices here. Please contact us for information 
about support for other devices.
