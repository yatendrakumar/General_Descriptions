An operating system is a computer program that supports a 
computer's basic functions, and provides services to other
programs (or applications) that run on the computer. 

The applications provide the functionality that the user of
the computer wants or needs. The services provided by the 
operating system make writing the applications faster, 
simpler, and more maintainable. If you are reading this
web page, then you are using a web browser (the application
program that provides the functionality you are interested in),
which will itself be running in an environment provided by an
operating system.
