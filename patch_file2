********************************* patch file creation and how to patch ?

before doing this, please backup your source code, patch wrongly 
will screwup your source code.

********************************* how to create patch file?

Patch file is a readable file that created by diff with -c 
(context output format). 

It doesn’t matter and if you wanna know more, man diff. 

To patch the entire folder of source codes(as usually people do)
I do as bellow:

Assume Original source code at folder Tb01, and latest source 
code at folder Tb02. And there have multiple sub directories at 
Tb01 and Tb02 too.

====> diff -crB Tb01 Tb02 > Tb02.patch

-c context, -r recursive (multiple levels dir), -B is to ignore
Blank Lines.

put -B because blank lines is really useless for patching, 
sometimes I need to manually read the patch file to track the changes, \
without -B is really headache.

********************************** How to patch?

First of all, please do a dry-run before really patch it. 

Bare in mind, patch will be working very specifically. 

Let say the version 3 Tb03.patch is use to patch from Tb02, 
if you apply patch on Tb01, sometimes it will corrupt your source code. 
So, to make sure it works, do a dry run. 

Dry-run means a fake-test, do it at the directory of the source code 
targeted to patch.

Doing dry-run like this:

====> patch --dry-run -p1 -i Tb02.patch

The success output looks like this:

patching file TbApi.cpp
patching file TbApi.h
patching file TbCard.cpp
...

The failure ouptut looks like this:

patching file TbCard.cpp
Hunk #2 FAILED at 585.
1 out of 2 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file TbCard.cpp.rej
patching file TbCard.h
Hunk #1 FAILED at 57.
Hunk #2 FAILED at 77.
Hunk #3 succeeded at 83 with fuzz 1 (offset -21 lines).
....


At last, if the dry-run is giving good result, 
do this and enjoy the compilation.


====> patch -p1 -i Tb02.patch

******************************************************************************************

Second, if there were files in Tb02 that did not exist in Tb01 and 
you want them included in the patch, give diff the -N option:

diff -crBN Tb01 Tb02 > Tb02.patch

Lastly, I’d note that diff and patch really only work with text files. 
It can’t deal with jpegs, pdfs, or other binary objects.

This can be a bit of a pain for web and GUI developers.
