To patch a file means to modify it, with the connotation 
that the modification is generally small. 

The usage comes from the general English usage where a patch 
is a small modification (to a piece of cloth, for example). 

When it comes to files, a patch is not always a repair.

A patch is a series of instructions that describe how to modify 
a file or a set of files. 

In the unix world, a patch is usually the output of the diff command, 
describing changes in a text file. A patch in this sense describes 
the modifications in terms of adding, removing or modifying lines 
in the files. The patch utility applies these instructions to modify 
a file or set of files. 


It tries to be smart about applying multiple patches to the same file, 
as the first patch could cause changes that prevent the second one 
from being applies because the file is no longer in the expected state. 
Because diff and patch strongly base their operation on lines, 
they are not well-suited to binary files.
