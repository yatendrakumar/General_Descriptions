The Linux kernel debugger (KDB) allows you to debug the Linux kernel. 
This aptly named tool is essentially a patch to the kernel code that 
lets hackers access kernel memory and data structures. 
One of the main advantages of KDB is that it does not require an 
additional machine for debugging: you can debug the kernel that you 
are running on.

The latest version of KDB available (at the time this article was written)
is 4.2. You'll need to download and apply two patches. 
One is the "common" patch that contains the changes for the generic 
kernel code, and the other is the architecture-specific patch.
